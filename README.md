## Ivan Edward - Ungraduated Informatics Engineering Student & Backend Web Developer

I am an undergraduate Informatics Engineering student at Esa Unggul University with a strong interest in backend web development.
My focus is on building web applications with clear structure, maintainable code, and practical deployment setups.

I primarily work with PHP-based technologies and enjoy working on the server side, from application logic to environment configuration.

### Areas of Interest
- Backend web application development
- Server-side rendering with PHP and Blade
- Structured application and routing
- Containerized development using Docker
- Web server configuration (Nginx)

### Current Direction
At this stage, I am focusing on strengthening fundamentals through academic and personal projects.
The emphasis is on understanding how applications are structured and deployed, rather than building feature-heavy products.
